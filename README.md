# Snake Game using vanilla JavaScript

### A vanilla JavaScript game 

just like we use to play in the nokia mobile in old days if you remember

The Game is grid-based (10 X 10), in which I covered the following :
  1. event listeners
  2. query Selectors
  3. arrow functions
  4. forEach
  5. setting time intervals and countdowns
